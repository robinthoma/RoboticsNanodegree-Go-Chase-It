![Go Chase It Image](Screenshot.png)

## Introduction
This project involves designing and building a mobile robot that is capable of chasing and following white colored balls.

## Structure
There are two packages within this repository:

### 1. my_robot
This package defines the mobile robot under URDF as well the world that it is housed within.

### 2. ball_chaser
This package contains two nodes which are responsible for locating the position of the white ball in the camera field of view and then sending the corresponding commands to the mobile robot to follow the white ball.
